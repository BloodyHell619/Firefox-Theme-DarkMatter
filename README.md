<p align="center">Dark Perfection for FireFox Proton</p>
<p align="center">- What's new from Kyubi theme -</p>
<p align="center">- All the color codes are now implemented into the css files; so no need to guess colors, and no need for the Theme Creator plugin. Just a simple copy-paste and enabling 1 or 2 options in settings is all you need to apply this theme.</p>
<p align="center">- Added depth to the entire theme to get rid of its flatness and plainness.</p>
<p align="center">- Compact tabs made for Proton (Tabs will also not expand even when you open a lot, as all the toolbar icons have been fixed and resized to prevent that.)
<p align="center">- Truly button shaped nabvar buttons</p>
<p align="center">-Dark theme extended to as many places as possible (Extended from the interface and menus all the way to the LIBRARY and even stuff such as the "save as popups" and right click menu (regardless of your system's theme!)</p>
<p align="center">- Added Vertical tabs</p>
<p align="center">- New customized Bookmark Toolbar</p>
<p align="center">- Custom volume icon</p>
<p align="center">- Animated tab close button</p>
<p align="center">- Menu-in-toolbar feature</p>
<p align="center">- Custom website focus and text highlight colors
and tones and tones of other big and minor changes</p>
