<p align="center">Unlike my previous theme which needed you to use an add-on called Theme Creator and to figure out colors, there is no need for that with this theme as all the colors are coded into the CSS files</p>

<p align="center">Vertical tabs</p>
<p align="center">Dark embossed theme pretty much everywhere; from the tinnest places in the interface, settings, add-on tab, ... all the way to the library and even on to stuff like the right-click menu and save as pop-ups (This is also applied regardless of your operating system's theme!) and even about:config
box shaped compact tabs even in firefox proton which has removed the compact view mode (Tabs will not expand even if you open up too many as all the toolbar buttons have been resized and fixed delecatly to prevent exapnsion)</p>
